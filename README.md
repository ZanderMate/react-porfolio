## Description

This is my porfolio using what we have learned in react.js classes. I decided to go with a new look for the portfolio so I browsed for a CSS template that would work well for what I had envisioned. I came across a W3 School's template and I really liked it so I incorporated the CSS into a react.js framework.

## Technology

* React.js
* Javascript
* CSS (courtesy of W3Schools.com)

## Instructions

1. Upon opening the page, you should see a static sidebar that will navigate you to the three sections: Projects, About Me, and Contact.

2. In the 'Projects' section, each project has a screenshot, a link to the repository, and a link to the deployed app.

3. In the 'About Me' section, there is the obligitory picture of me and a short informational autobiographical blurb about my journey to web developer. It also includes my email, phone number, links to GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and a PDF of my résumé.

4. In the 'Contact' section, a user can enter their name, email, and a message to me. Or it would, if it currently worked.
